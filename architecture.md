TODO

  Name of move -> unique
  Shorthand for move -> unique
  Description for move -> multi line text input

Q - A personal website

There exists a way to programmatically increase my ability
This app can also be used to assist instruction in class

1. Take video of a move occurring
2. Upload and convert into gif
3. Associate with a specific move

Depending on whether we're creating a move or a sequence, render a different form

1. Name
2. Shorthand
